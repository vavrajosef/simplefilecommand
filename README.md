I do not take any responsibility for damage that can be done by using this software.
This application is capable of deleting files, links, directories(regardles of emptiness). 

Using keys:
5 = copy active file to inactive directory;
6 = move active file to inactive directory;
7 = create directory in active directory, input is required afterwards(name);
8 = create regular file in active directory, input is required afterwards(name);
9 = create link in active directory, input is required afterwards(name, target);
d = delete active file in active directory;
r = regex, input is required afterwards(regular expression, action(copy, move, delete));
q = exit;
